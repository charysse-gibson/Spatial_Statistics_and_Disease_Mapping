<b>Behavioral Risk Factors Explaining Excess Stroke Mortality Rates in Texas Counties: A Stroke Belt Study</b><br><br>
A project exploring stroke belt behavioral risk factors (i.e. smoking, physical inactivity, excessive drinking) and excess stroke mortality rates in Texas counties. RMarkdown file includes code for:
* Chloropleth Maps
* Moran's I
* Monte Carlo Simulation of Moran's I
* Conditional Autoregessive Model

<br>

<b>Cloropleth Mapping</b><br><br>
Code for chloropleth mapping of infant deaths and chlamydia cases among Georgia counties.

<br>

<b>KDE, Hex Binning, Estimating K Function</b><br><br>
Utilize Hutchings' Bramble Canes data for the following:
* Kernel Density Estimate
* Heat Maps
* Hexagonal Binning + Hex-Binned Plots
* Estimate K Function + Envelope for Testing CSR

<br>

<b>MCMC, CAR, Posterior Distribution</b><br><br>
Analysis of smoking and pancreatic cancer rates in Minnesota via:
* Chloropleth Maps
* Moran's I 
* Monte-Carlo Simulation of Moran's I (spatial autocorrelation)
* Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) Regression Model 
* Trace Plots for Alpha, Beta, Tau, Tau[1], Theta[1], and Theta[2]
* Tau vs Tau[1] (Log-log and Linear Scale)
* Posterior Distirbution of beta with 95% Highest Density Interval
